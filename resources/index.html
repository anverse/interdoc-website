        <summary class="cursor-pointer">Why you should try to avoid code comments as much as possible</summary>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Code Comments can be used to explain the purpose of a piece of code, or to provide additional context or
          information about how it works. While comments can help explain the intent of a piece of code, they can also
          become outdated or misleading if they are not kept up-to-date with the code. In addition, comments do not add
          any value to the actual functioning of the code, and can even make the code harder to read if they are
          excessively used or are not written clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, it is generally a good idea to try to avoid using comments as much as possible and to rely on
          well-named variables, functions, and clear code structure to convey the purpose and functionality of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are situations where comments can be useful and can help make the code easier to understand.
          For example, comments can be used to provide explanations for particularly complex or subtle pieces of code or
          to provide context for why a certain design decision was made.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, it is best to use comments sparingly and to focus on writing clear, self-explanatory code. When
          comments are necessary, they should be written in a way that is concise, accurate, and easy to understand.

        <summary class="mt-5 cursor-pointer">Where documentation makes sense</summary>
        <p class="mt-2">
          There are many things that we cannot see just by reading the code, and in these cases, documentation is often
          necessary to provide a full understanding of the code's purpose and functionality. It's important to recognize
          the importance of documentation and to make it a priority in the software development process. By starting
          with the needs of the reader and focusing on clear and concise explanations, we can create documentation that
          is easy to understand and use. This will not only benefit the developers who are working on the code, but also
          end users and future developers who may need to modify or maintain the code in the future.
        </p>
        <p>Some examples of things that may not be immediately apparent from reading the code include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>The overall architecture and design of the code</b>: Code can often be organized in complex and
            hierarchical ways, and it can be difficult to understand the big picture just by reading individual lines of
            code. Documentation can help to explain the overall structure and design of the code, and can provide
            context for how the different parts of the code fit together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The intended use of the code</b>: Code can often be used in a variety of different ways, and it's not
            always clear how it is intended to be used just by reading the code. Documentation can help to provide
            examples of how the code can be used, as well as any limitations or constraints that need to be considered.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The reasoning behind certain code decisions</b>: Code can often be written in a variety of different ways
            to solve the same problem, and it's not always clear why a particular approach was chosen just by reading
            the code. Documentation can help to explain the reasoning behind certain code decisions, and can provide
            context for why certain approaches were chosen over others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Known issues or potential problems</b>: Code is not always perfect, and there may be known issues or
            potential problems that are not immediately apparent just by reading the code. Documentation can help to
            identify and document these issues, and can provide guidance on how to address them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, documentation is often necessary to provide a full understanding of the code, and to help developers
          to use and modify it effectively. By including information about the overall architecture and design of the
          code, the intended use of the code, the reasoning behind certain code decisions, and known issues or potential
          problems, developers can create documentation that is comprehensive and useful.

        <summary class="mt-5 cursor-pointer">What kind of documentation should I write?</summary>

        <ul class="mt-2">
          <li>
            <b>Setup guide and codebase structure</b>: Code documentation is generally most useful for larger, more
            complex software systems, where it can help to provide a high-level overview of the overall design and
            organization of the codebase. It can also be helpful for new developers joining a project, as it can provide
            them with context and background information about the codebase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ADR (Architecture Decision Record)</b>: An ADR (Architecture Decision Record) is a document that records
            a decision made about the architecture or design of a software system. It typically includes information
            about the problem being addressed, the options considered, and the decision made, as well as the rationale
            behind the decision. ADRs are often used in agile development processes to help track and document decisions
            made about the design and architecture of a software system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>RFC (Request for Comments)</b>: An RFC (Request for Comments) is a document that outlines a proposal or
            change to a software system, and solicits feedback and comments from the broader community of developers
            working on the project. An RFC typically includes a detailed description of the proposed change, as well as
            the benefits and potential drawbacks of the proposal. RFCs are often used in open source projects to
            encourage collaboration and open discussion about proposed changes to the codebase.

      <h2>The missing link between code and documentation</h2>
      <p>
        The missing link between code and documentation is often a lack of integration between the two. When code and
        documentation are not integrated, it can be easy for them to drift apart quickly as the code changes and
        evolves.
        <br />
        Difficulty in keeping documentation in sync with the code: Without an automated process for keeping
        documentation in sync with the code, it can be easy for the two to drift apart.
        <br />
        To address these issues and ensure that developers see the value in reading documentation, it's important to
        create documentation that is well-organized, easy to find, and easy to understand. This can include linking the
        documentation directly to the code, providing clear and concise explanations, and including examples and other
        supporting materials to help make the documentation more useful and approachable. By making the documentation
        more visible and accessible, developers are more likely to see the value in reading it and will be more likely
        to use it to help them understand the code.
